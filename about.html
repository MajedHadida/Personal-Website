                    My name is Majed, and I am currently 3rd year in Computer Science
                    at Wilfrid Laurier University. Besides my major in Computer Science,
                    I also minor in User Experience Design. My interest in computer science
                    began with Scratch, a high-level visual programming language. Ever since
                    then I slowly began to learn Java, Python and C. Although I learned a lot
                    of my knowledge came from university, some also came from my spare time.
                    For example, I took my own time to learn how to use HTML, CSS and JS. Thus,
                    this is how this website was made! I've also dabbled in a bit of C# through Unity.
                    I always want to learn new languages because each language has a different 
                    approach to different problems. I look forward to experiencing a professional 
                    environment where everyone is sharing a similar passion and interest.
