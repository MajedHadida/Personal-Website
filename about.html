            <p>
                My name is Majed, and I am currently 3rd year in Computer Science
                at Wilfrid Laurier University. Besides my major in Computer Science,
                I also minor in User Experience Design. My interest in computer science
                began with Scratch, a high-level visual programming language. Ever since
                then I slowly began to learn Java, Python and C. Although a lot
                of my knowledge came from university, some also came from my spare time.
                For example, I took my own time to learn how to use HTML, CSS and JS. Thus,
                this is how this website was made! I've also dabbled in a bit of C# through Unity.
                I always want to learn new languages because each language has a different
                approach to different problems. I look forward to experiencing a professional
                environment where everyone is sharing a similar passion and interest.
